## Automation of adding new products to the store.

6. Translate the product description into the Dutch language.
7. Generate missing product information (e.g., product clickable name, product description, category)
8. Generate seo information (e.g., meta title, meta description, meta keywords).

## Integration of the store with drop-shipping portals.

1. Update the product price.
2. Update the product stock.
3. Create orders.

## Integration of the store with marketplace type portals (e.g., Bol, Allegro).

1. Update the product price.
2. Update the product stock.
3. Create orders.
4. Update order status.

## Way of integration

The information from drop-shipping portals will go to the e-commerce platform and from e-commerce platform to the
marketplace type portals.
This way of integration will put the e-commerce platform in the center of the integration.
Therefore, adding new drop-shipping portals or marketplace will have always one endpoint to integrate with.
